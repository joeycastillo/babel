     @note OK! SO. The typesetter would LOVE to be completely agnostic about what kind of device it's rendering to. It would, like, love nothing more than to not ever have to query the underlying object that's `drawPixel`'ing. So if you have a 128x128 TFT and you want it to use the whole thing, have at! Pass in `0, 0, 128, 128` and typesetter will call your drawPixel method on all those pixels. For the 400x300 book, I'm probably going to specify some tasteful margins like `16, 16, 268, 368`.
